# ml-art-bootcamp
Machine Learning for the Arts Bootcamp at UCSD, Spring 2019

https://github.com/roberttwomey/ml-art-bootcamp

"Length": 5 hrs
Date: Thursday 5/21 10am-3pm.
Location: Qualcomm Conference Center, Jacobs School of Engineering.
Description
This bootcamp is a one day intensive introduction to Art and Machine Learning (ML), in advance of the Special Topics course offered through ECE. The goal is to introduce both the technical software tools and the conceptual application domain of ML and Art. Students who thrive in this bootcamp workshop will enjoy the quarter-long course.

ECE 16 is a prerequisite for this course, or equivalent experience with python and/or ML.

Detailed Schedule
0:00-0:30 - Introduction - For the first half hour the instructor will briefly survey that state of contemporary Machine Learning tools, and describe the importance of ML technologies to digital arts practice. Slideshow of important Art and ML projects.

0:30-1:00 - Style Transfer Activity - The instructor will briefly introduce neural style transfer, show significant examples of images made with the technique, and demonstrate online tools to accomplish style transfers. In a quick “sketching” exercise, students will have 20 minutes to experiment with style transfer software. They will select both the source style images and target images, and are asked to consider the meanings and aesthetics of their decisions.

1:00-1:15 - Style Transfer Discussion - Look at students work and discuss as a group.

1:15-1:30 - Hands on with Python and Tensorflow in jupyterhub - Instructor will introduce our ML software development environment. We will use the TensorFlow framework through python notebooks running in jupyterhub. For the bootcamp, these resources are pre-configured as virtual machine images running on Kubernetes, to skip time consuming software install processes. 

1:30-2:00 - MNIST Activity - Students will work through a provided MNIST digit recognition example in TensorFlow, training a recognition model, and then running it on hand-written samples they capture with their cellphones to explore the inferential capabilities and limitations of their model.

2:00-2:30 - Implementing Your Own Style Transfer in TensorFlow - Students will work with a provided partial implementation of neural style transfer in TensorFlow, completing the implementation, and experimenting with their own style transfer function to produce new images. 

2:30-3:00 - Break

3:00-3:15 - Implementation Discussion

3:15-4:30 - Advanced Generative Methods for Images - Instructor will introduce advanced generative methods for images, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Students will work with provided code to experiment with a GAN. 

4:30-5:00 - Closing Discussion - Students will briefly share their progress from the GAN activity and we will have a closing discussion. Upload workshop products to an Art and ML blog at the conclusion of the course. Instructor will answer questions about the course, and students will fill out course applications, if they are interested.
